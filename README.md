# UIEssentials

A World of Warcraft addon that provides essential UI enhancements to improve your gameplay experience. Initially built over one week as a learning project to understand how addons work. After years of playing WoW, I figured "why not" create my own. Learning Lua while building something for a game I play so much made the process much more engaging. I've also aimed to keep it lightweight and performant as far as I could understand at this point in time.

## Features

### Tooltip Enhancement

- Shows what a unit is currently targeting
- Displays which party/raid members are targeting them
- Color-coded names by class and faction for quick recognition

### Realm Name Removal

- Automatically removes realm names from party frames
- Automatically removes realm names from raid frames
- Keeps your UI clean when playing with cross-realm players, without removing realm on tooltips.

### Character Features

- Displays item level with decimal precision in the character frame
- Provides more accurate item level information for min-maxing

### UI Features

- Optional green cursor highlight to help track your cursor position
- Useful for gameplay recording or accessibility

### Item Comparison

- Add Shift to compare BACK into WoW, recently Blizzard added auto comparison which this disables

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Place the `UIEssentials` folder in your `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\` directory
3. Restart WoW or reload UI (`/reload`)

## Usage

Simply hover over any unit to see the enhanced tooltip with targeting information. All features are enabled by default.

### Configuration

Access the options panel to toggle features on/off:

- Type `/ue` or `/uiessentials` in chat
- Or navigate to **ESC → Interface → AddOns → UIEssentials**

Available options:

- **Show targeting information in tooltips** - Display who is targeting what
- **Show item level decimals** - Display item level with decimal precision
- **Show green cursor highlight** - Display a green square at cursor position
- **Hide realm names in raid frames** - Clean up raid frame names
- **Hide realm names in party frames** - Clean up party frame names
- **Auto skip all cutscenes** - Automatically skip cutscenes and movies
- **Disable auto-comparison (Shift to compare)** - Restore classic Shift-to-compare behavior

Changes require a UI reload (`/reload`) to take effect.
